## Overview

## Prerequisites

[nodejs](https://nodejs.org)

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned the repository run `yarn` to install the package dependencies.
Then run `yarn develop` to build the package, link it to the demos application and run the demos application on `http://localhost:3000` - hot reloading is enabled so any changes made to the package will be immediately reflected in the application.
